# Novel Approach for Lithology Prediction from Well-Logging Data Using Machine Learning And Deep Learning Techniques

Notes:
1. The code is written based on python3. 
2. It is better than the mentioned packages for proper execution
  Use it in the requirements file. (use venv and pip install -r requirements.txt)
3. XGBoost.ipyn only contains the XGBoost model
4. Main.ipyn contains all models.
5. The Lithofacies_Classification folder contains the models and Functions used.
